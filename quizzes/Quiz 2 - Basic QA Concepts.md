# Quiz 2: Basic QA Concepts

## 1. What is the primary goal of Quality Assurance (QA)? [single]

- [ ] To find bugs in the product.
- [x] To ensure the product meets quality standards.
- [ ] To release software on time.
- [ ] To test the entire product.

## 2. Which of the following are functional testing types? [multiple]

- [x] Unit testing
- [x] Integration testing
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Usability testing

## 3. What is black-box testing? [single]

- [x] Testing without knowledge of the internal workings of the application.
- [ ] Testing with access to source code.
- [ ] Testing the application's user interface only.
- [ ] Testing based on the developer's perspective.

## 4. What does a "severity" level in a bug report indicate? [single]

- [x] The impact of the bug on the system.
- [ ] The frequency of the bug.
- [ ] How quickly the bug needs to be fixed.
- [ ] The steps to reproduce the bug.

## 5. Select the main activities in Agile testing: [multiple]

- [x] Test planning in every sprint
- [x] Continuous integration testing
- [ ] User acceptance testing only after release
- [ ] Testing only after coding is complete

## 6. Select the types of non-functional testing: [multiple]

- [ ] Unit testing
- [ ] Functional testing
- [x] Performance testing
- [x] Security testing

## 7. In Agile methodology, what is a "sprint"? [single]

- [x] A time-boxed iteration where a set of features is developed and tested.
- [ ] The final phase of development before release.
- [ ] A bug-fixing cycle.
- [ ] A release candidate.

## 8. What is boundary value analysis? [single]

- [x] Testing at the edges of input ranges.
- [ ] Testing the internal logic of the program.
- [ ] Finding performance bottlenecks.
- [ ] Testing random values.

## 9. What is the difference between verification and validation? [single]

- [ ] Verification checks the code; validation tests the database.
- [ ] Verification is done by testers; validation is done by developers.
- [x] Verification ensures the product is built correctly, validation ensures the correct product is built.
- [ ] There is no difference.

## 10. Which of the following are key benefits of regression testing? [multiple]

- [x] Ensures that recent code changes do not break existing functionality.
- [x] Helps identify defects in the existing codebase.
- [ ] Performed only in the final phase of development.
- [ ] Reduces the need for functional testing.
